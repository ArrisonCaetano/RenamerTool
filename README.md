### ⚠️ Note about Godot UI refresh

After clicking the **Rename** button and seeing the feedback message, the folders and files **may not appear renamed immediately** in the FileSystem dock.

This is a known limitation of the Godot editor — it doesn't always refresh the file tree in real time.  
To force the UI to refresh and see the changes:

- Click outside of the Godot window (e.g., `Alt + Tab`)
- Minimize and restore the editor window  
These actions will typically cause the editor to reload the file structure and show the correct new names.

### 🔹 Ideal for:
- Batch-renaming folders before importing them into Godot
- Fast cleanup of messy asset directories
- Use in non-Godot workflows or to preprocess external asset packs
