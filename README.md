## 🐍 Also included: Python Rename Tool

This plugin also includes a **standalone Python-based tool** called `PythonRenameTool`, designed for quick command-line or drag-and-drop use outside of Godot:

### 🔹 How it works:
- Contains an executable (`RenameCamelCase.exe`) that you can drag and drop any folder onto.
- When run, it will automatically rename all files and folders within the selected directory to **camelCase**.
- No setup or configuration needed — just **drag the folder**, **drop on the executable**, and you're done!

### 🔹 Ideal for:
- Batch-renaming folders before importing them into Godot
- Fast cleanup of messy asset directories
- Use in non-Godot workflows or to preprocess external asset packs
